# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to become more familiar with JavaScript. To accomplish this we were given the following the scenario:
A data journalist (Dana) is far enough into her career that she can choose the topics that she writes about. When she is given the oppertunity to write about her hometown, she decides to write about UFOs, as her hometown is well known for UFO sightings. We are going to help her build a dynamic webpage with a table that can be filtered by various data. In accopmlishing this, we learned the following items:
- the differences between JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+
- JavaScript syntax
- how to build and deploy JavaScript functions
- how to convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions
- how to create for loops in JavaScript
- how to create and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML
## Results
If someone were curious about UFO sightings in their area, they might type in a random date, their city, state, country and random shape.
## Summary
One drawback is that the criteria is extremely specific. For example, if a user types in a date, location and shape of a UFO that was sighted, but the shape they type in wasn't sighted, the table will return no results. Thus, my first recommendation to Dana would be to change the date to a range. This way, a user is more likely to see results when they type in the rest of the criteria. I would also recommend a feature to return results similar to what the user is looking for. For example, if the user types in "circle" for the shape, they should have an option of the table returning similar shapes, such as "sphere" and "disc."
