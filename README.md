# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to become more familiar with JavaScript. To accomplish this we were given the following the scenario:
A data journalist (Dana) is far enough into her career that she can choose the topics that she writes about. When she is given the oppertunity to write about her hometown, she decides to write about UFOs, as her hometown is well known for UFO sightings. We are going to help her build a dynamic webpage with a table that can be filtered by various data. In accomplishing this, we learned the following items:
- the differences between JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+
- JavaScript syntax
- how to build and deploy JavaScript functions
- how to convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions
- how to create for loops in JavaScript
- how to create and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML
## Results
If someone wants to look up UFO sightings, all they have to do is type in a date, city, state, country, and shape. (See Fig. 1)

## Summary
One huge drawback is that the data is extremely limited. The data only ranges from the first to the 13th of January in 2010. Thus, my first recommendation to Dana would be to vastly expand her data. I would recommend two options to accomplish this. One option is to webscrape from a source that is continually or somewhat regularly updating new sightings that people are reporting.  Another option would be to gather data over a relatively recent 5 or 10 year period with all the ufo sightings recorded reported in the us during that time period. However, I'd highly recommend the webscrape option to keep her information up-to-date. Additionally, I would recommend making an option to search for a range of dates, instead of just one specific date. I would also ask Dana if she intends on using only data in the US. If so, I'd recommend eliminating the option to type in a country since she is only looking at US data. If she intends on using other countries' data as well, I would even more strongly encourage her to use the webscrape option. In that case, I would advise her to see if she can find a source that has reports of ufos from multiple countries.
